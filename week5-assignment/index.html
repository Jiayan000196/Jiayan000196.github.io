            <p>
             My name is Jiayan Wu, and I go by Tiffany at school. Nice to meet you. I was born and raised in 
             Shanghai, China. I came to Ottawa on 19<sup>th</sup>, 2015. I chose to be a homemaker when 
             I found out I was pregnant 5 years ago. Our life has been traditional, simple, and maybe 
             borning to some. But we all try to find little joy every day.

             My childhood was simple but meaningful. My mon is a devoted Buddhist and so do I. I still remember 
             the days that my mom and I went to Vihara to pray on Saturday mornings, and enjoyed the delicious
             vegan food in the resturant. We embrance the concepts of <abbr title="KARMA AND REINCARNATION">
             KAR</abbr> in my family.
