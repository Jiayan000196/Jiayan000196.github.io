    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Jiayan Wu, and I go by Tiffany at school. Nice to meet you. I was born and raised in
      Shanghai, China. I came to Ottawa on 19<sup>th</sup>, 2015. I chose to be a homemaker when
      I found out I was pregnant 5 years ago. Our life has been traditional, simple, and maybe
      borning to some. But we all try to find little joy every day.
    </p>

      My childhood was simple but meaningful. My mon is a devoted Buddhist and so do I. I still remember
      the days that my mom and I went to Vihara to pray on Saturday mornings, and enjoyed the delicious
      vegan food in the resturant. We embrance the concepts of <abbr title="KARMA AND REINCARNATION">
        KAR</abbr> in my family.
